PAAS that runs on top of [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/).

## Development

You can configure the app for local development using a `.env` file in the root of the project. You should copy `.env.example` to `.env` to get started.
The example file will have all of the required config with sensible defaults.

#### Local database

A test database is provided using Docker. The `.env.example` file provided is configured to connect to this database by default. To start the database [install Docker] for
your machine and run
```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

This will start a database listening on `localhost:33062` with the username `root` and password `secret`. It will also setup a database named `brizo`.

#### Database migrations

Migrations will run against the database when Brizo starts up. If the app is running in development mode (`BRIZO_DEV=true`) a subcommand is provided to control migrations.
```sh
$ go build
$ ./brizo migrate
$ ./brizo migrate --down
```

#### Local Kubernetes

You must have a Kubernetes cluster available for development. You can setup a quick test cluster locally using [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube). The default
environment in `.env.example` is configured to connect to a minikube cluster.

#### UI

The JS UI is isolated to the `ui` directory. See the [UI Readme](https://github.com/generationtux/brizo/tree/master/ui) for development info.

#### Autoreload

You can use [Fresh](https://github.com/pilu/fresh) to serve and autoreload the service during development.

Install Fresh
```sh
$ go get github.com/pilu/fresh
```

Then run the app
```sh
$ fresh
```

#### Dependency management

Dependencies are managed using [Govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor). For simpliciy in version management
dependencies are committed with the repo.
